Colonial Gothic Character Sheet for Roll20


This is a simple example character sheet. Very basic as it is my first sheet I have made. Based of of the Kitchen Sink Roll 20 sheet for Savage Worlds. It is not even close to being finished but will be updated until then.

Need to figure out how to do modifiers for abilities. Once done, assign modifiers to skill instead of flat skill score.

Need to figure out weapons section with all necessary fields.
